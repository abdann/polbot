# polbot
A revamp of Pol Bot, written in python.

Uses discord.py 2.0, which you can install via pip as so:
`pip install git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py`

~~As of June 24th, 2022 I am no longer maintaining this project for the foreseeable future.~~ Development has resumed but at a slowed pace. I have decided to make this an open source project.
